Newsletter Project
======================
Overview
------------
This is a quick experiment with a newsletter signup page. I built this project to test my skills and try out new things.
Features Implemented
-------------------------

    Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
    Form validation for email input
    Additional form validation for phone number input (not part of the original project requirements)
    Error messages displayed for invalid inputs

Deviations from Project Requirements
----------------------------------------

    Added an extra phone number input field for testing form validation with multiple inputs
    Did not exactly follow the project's design specifications

Known Issues and Improvements
-----------------------------------

    Form validation can be improved by adding more specific error messages for different types of invalid inputs
    Phone number input validation can be enhanced by allowing for different formats (e.g., +1 XXX-XXX-XXXX)
    CSS styles can be optimized for better performance and maintainability
